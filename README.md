# wanscript
This is my personal collection of useful script for Windows desktop

1. KanjiTomo - To be used with Kanjitomo program for OCR Japanese-English dictionary. Make it convenient to auto-toggle OCR, change input to JP/ENG, etc
2. FlexGetAutoJDownloader - Flexget script. Add it to Flexget's config.yml (read its docs). To be used with Jdownloader if you have seedbox. If a new file is downloaded into a particular directory, this script will monitor it and add it to Jdownloader. Can also trigger autodownload.
3. MoveFileFromDesktop - Simple AutoHotkey script to move file/directory from desktop to Documents/desktop. Does not work with some file because the extension need to be added manually.
4. Plex - Script that is somewhat related to plex. 
- Matroskasubmerge.py - merge .mkv file with its subtitle .ass file. 
- Plexrefresh.py - refresh Plex library. Useful if you want your Plex library to refresh under 5 minute, since Plex set minimum refresh to be 5 minutes. 
5. switchApptoOtherMonitor - My finest creation. Quickly move an application or folder or whatever to other monitor by one press of button.
