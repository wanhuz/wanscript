# wanscript
This is my personal collection of useful script for Windows desktop

1. KanjiTomo - To be used with Kanjitomo program for OCR Japanese-English dictionary. Make it convenient to auto-toggle OCR, change input to JP/ENG, etc
2. FlexGetAutoJDownloader - Flexget script. Add it to Flexget's config.yml (read its docs). To be used with Jdownloader if you have seedbox. If a new file is downloaded into a particular directory, this script will monitor it and add it to Jdownloader. Can also trigger autodownload.
3. MoveFileFromDesktop - Simple AutoHotkey script to move file/directory from desktop to Documents/desktop. Does not work with some file because the extension need to be added manually.
